# SAFE.NET-NSFW-BLOCKER-EXTENTION
NSFW BLOCKER/FILTER EXTENTION FOR CHROME/FIREFOX USING Tensorflow.js + WEB PHISHING DETECTION (WEBSITE + EXTENSION)

TAG LINE:- SAFE.NET- SECURE AND SAFE BROWSING
We created a website for detection of phishing website with chrome extension, 
which can be downloaded from this website and install as a chrome extension. Not only this we have a bonus extension as well,
to Block NSFW images from chrome/firefox using Tensorflow.js.
WE USED MACHINE LEARNING AND TENSORFLOW.js in this project.
# ABOUT NSFW BLOCKER EXTENSION:-
Not-Safe-For-Work images can be described as any images which can be deemed inappropriate in a workplace primarily because it may contain:

    Sexual or pornographic images
    Violence
    Extreme graphics like gore or abusive
    Suggestive content

For example, LinkedIn is a professional platform where users interact in a professional way.
However, it allows users to write and share content. So, it has to ensure that the content is safe for work.

When a web page is loaded, all the images remain hidden until they are found to be NSFW or not. 
If they are found to be NSFW, they remain hidden. Otherwise, they become visible.

    It will lead to information disclosure and property damage.

    Large organizations may get trapped in different kinds of scams.
    
   ## Project mainly focuses on applying a machine-learning algorithm to detect Phishing websites.
